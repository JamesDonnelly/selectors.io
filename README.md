#[Selectors.io](https://selectors.io)
https://selectors.io is an online CSS Selector deconstructor which aims to answer the age-old question of ‘What does this CSS selector do?’

##Examples
Load up https://selectors.io and paste any of the following CSS Selectors into the selector input area at the top to have the site attempt to deconstruct them and tell you exactly what they are selecting:

| Selector |
| :--- |
| `.list-group-item > .badge + .badge` ([Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)) |
| `a[href^="http:"]` ([A Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/3859101/1317805)) |
| <code>ns&#124;*</code> ([Selectors Level 3 W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#univnmsp)) |
| `audio:not([controls])` ([Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)) |
